Research Mind Institute is an organization encouraging students to find depth in learning and application to life through it. With a philosophy encompassing and prioritizing self-improvement, Research Mind values depth of understanding, real-world application and impact, and self-driven passion for greater insight.

Our philosophy strives to unlock the "research mind" in students, a learning method and thought process that allows them to connect studies with experiences and pose questions that delve into the front-line of the professional field. This learning method is not bound to primary nor secondary education, but reaches throughout the course of one's life as an essential framework. This philosophy is supported by the lives and examples of historical figures, whose experiences contribute as proof; Abraham Lincoln, who studied Euclid's Elements during his law career, discovered through it a sturdy platform of mathematical logic that became the backbone of his legal and political career -- and, later, many of his most famous speeches.
